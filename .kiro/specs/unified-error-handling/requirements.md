# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to standardize error handling across the UserService.cs by replacing the existing inconsistent error patterns with a unified approach using the AuthError structure and creating a generic extension method for protobuf error types. Currently, the UserService uses a mix of AuthError objects and specific response error enums, leading to inconsistent error handling and validation patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the authentication service, I want all UserService methods to use consistent error handling, so that error responses are predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any UserService method encounters an error THEN it SHALL return an AuthError object with appropriate Type, Message, and Validation fields
2. WHEN replacing existing error enums THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility by mapping enum values to corresponding AuthErrorReason values
3. WHEN implementing new error handling THEN existing validation logic SHALL be preserved and integrated with the new error structure
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL populate the ValidationIssue collection with detailed field-level errors
5. WHEN an unknown error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a generic error with appropriate logging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with protobuf error types, I want a generic extension method for error handling, so that I can consistently create and populate error responses across different services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the extension method THEN it SHALL be generic to work with any protobuf error type that has ValidationIssue support
2. WHEN the extension method is called THEN it SHALL be properly namespaced within the Fragments protobuf structure
3. WHEN using the extension method THEN it SHALL provide helper methods for common error scenarios (validation errors, not found errors, unauthorized errors)
4. WHEN the extension method handles validation THEN it SHALL work alongside existing ProtoValidate validation logic without replacing it initially

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing error responses, I want validation errors to be consistently formatted, so that client applications can reliably parse and display field-level errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL use the existing ValidationIssue structure with field, message, and code properties
2. WHEN multiple validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL collect all errors in a single response
3. WHEN field paths are complex THEN the system SHALL provide clear, dot-notation field paths
4. WHEN validation rules are violated THEN the system SHALL include the specific rule ID in the code field

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want error logging to be consistent across all UserService methods, so that I can effectively monitor and troubleshoot authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate details while protecting sensitive information
2. WHEN using the new error handling THEN existing logging patterns SHALL be preserved or improved
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log validation details for debugging purposes
4. WHEN the extension method is used THEN it SHALL support optional logging integration
